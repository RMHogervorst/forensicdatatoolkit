# Todo

[] read python version code (https://github.com/QuentinAndre/pysprite/blob/master/pysprite/pysprite.py)
[] implement check_sd version that uses sprite_seek vector 
[] implement a median version
[x] check differences in new code rSprite
[] create diffult distributions and try to re-discover them

> rSPRITE basically includes GRIM and GRIMMER, if you make it stop at the right points. GRIMMEST (Jordan's name for a test based on the granularity of F statistics) is not yet implemented in code as far as I know. James and I have not looked at fully automating DEBIT or RIVETS yet. DEBIT is trivial and doesn't need code. RIVETS needs custom code for almost every situation, but one can probably build off the example code that we supplied with the preprint.
